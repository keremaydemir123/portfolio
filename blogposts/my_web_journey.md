My interest in software development has been with me since high school. However, I couldn't get into a reputable computer engineering program at a university. My math teacher recommended *Middle East Technical University's Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering* program, and after some research, I decided it would be a good step in the direction of my dreams.

  

> At that time, my dream was to travel the world. Petroleum engineering offered good salaries, and from what I read online, engineers in the field could work for a month and then take a month off. This fulfilled the two basic requirements for me to travel the world: money and time.

  

I completed my first three years in petroleum engineering. I constantly thought about whether I should shift towards the software side. Whenever I had some free time, I was making games with **Unity** and thoroughly enjoying it.

  

During the winter break in my fourth year, I had an internship that I thought would help me make a decision. Either it would go very well, and I would continue in the petroleum sector, or I would start learning software development.

  

The internship actually went quite well. Being out in the field was enjoyable, but there were some aspects that didn't sit right with me. Engineers who were supposed to work for only three weeks were there for 55 days. They might have been making money, but they didn't seem very content with their lives. They were present for mandatory events and even during unfortunate incidents. They couldn't leave, and it seemed I wouldn't be able to travel the world as I had hoped if I stayed on this path. While not every workplace was like this, the private sector, in general, seemed to have this kind of demand.

  

***I decided to learn software development.*** This way, I could travel the world while working on software projects. With the impact of COVID, it seemed like remote work was becoming the norm worldwide.

  

So, what should I learn? I had some knowledge of **C** and a bit of **C#** for making games with Unity, but it was quite limited, and I needed to relearn these skills properly if I were to progress in this field. I needed to lay strong foundations.

  

While still in the decision-making phase, an organization called ***patika.dev*** came to our school during career days. I attended their presentation and had a conversation with them. I decided to start with them. Later, I did some research on their website and found that web development and React caught my interest. After some more investigation, I concluded that starting with ***frontend development*** made the most sense.

  

Creating games was a wonderful experience; everything turned out the way I wanted it to. I could unleash my creativity as I pleased. However, even making a bad game took quite a bit of time. Textures, graphics, animations, sound, story, performance, and many other elements *— each of them was crucial, and handling all of them alone required more than just coding*.

  

Web development seemed a bit easier and more achievable to me. Plus, it allowed me to express my creativity as well. I decided to start in this field.

  

Now, the next step was to create a roadmap. This roadmap would outline what I would learn in the future. While drawing this roadmap, I would familiarize myself with the industry's topics and start learning them after graduation. I knew that if I took a break along with exams, I wouldn't be able to regain my focus.

  

My motivation was quite high; this field truly appealed to me. I enjoyed researching and trying to create a React application, even though I didn't know much yet. But these were just part of the plan.

  

I found a blog page on GitHub and customized it for myself. In this blog, I planned to outline what I would do each month and share what I had accomplished (which didn't always happen). I had a 6-month plan, and it seemed sufficient for my initial goals. I shared this plan with a few developers on LinkedIn whose opinions I trusted, and they approved of it. The plan was a bit challenging, and I was worried about pushing myself too hard, and they echoed the same sentiment: "Don't overburn yourself."

I had immersed myself in this process. I was constantly planning what to do next, watching videos in the frontend field, and neglecting my classes. I had even become somewhat disconnected from school. All I did was play tennis and bridge, and in my remaining time, I worked on my software goals. As a result, I failed the thermodynamics course and had to extend my time at school by at least one semester (I could have graduated in July 😅).

  

***The calendar showed August 1, 2020.*** It was the first day of a long journey where I would systematically learn frontend development. I started working eagerly. I stuck to the plan and worked almost every day for about ***6-8 hours.***

  

In the first three months, I learned only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and developed projects. I compiled these projects in a [repository](https://github.com/keremaydemir123/small_projects)

  

Later on, I joined **"Fimple React Practicum"** organized by *patika.dev*. I hadn't learned **React** yet, but I thought I could learn it during this one-month period. To be eligible to join, they asked me to create a simple [tik-tak-toe](https://github.com/keremaydemir123/tic-tac-toe) game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I found relatively easy.

  

This practicum was a lot of fun for me, and I made two friends there. We were constantly in touch and exchanging knowledge. At the end of this practicum, I submitted my final project, but I didn't succeed. Now, when I look at the project, I can see how amateurish it was. It didn't turn out as expected, but it wasn't bad for my ***[first React project](https://github.com/keremaydemir123/fimple-final)***.

  

Afterwards, I wanted to collaborate on a project with a friend I met during this practicum. This project was going to be quite substantial.


 Instead of doing many small projects, I chose to tackle a big one. However, I was still at the beginning of my React journey. This project was a bit intimidating, but I was determined to do it.

At the start of the project, I pondered a lot about which technologies to use and decided on the following: **Frontend:** Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. **Backend:** Node.js, Fastify, Postgres, and Prisma. I had seen a YouTube video where they were building a system for commenting using these backend technologies, and I wanted to use that system, so I decided to start with that video.

  

Our project was progressing nicely, but learning new technologies and integrating them into our project proved to be challenging. I took a **TypeScript** course on *Udemy*. I had some CSS knowledge for Tailwind CSS, but I lacked practice, so I constantly had the Tailwind documentation open in a tab. For the backend, I kept examining various GitHub repositories, but Fastify was somewhat less common, and I had trouble adapting it to my needs.

  

As time went on, our project turned into spaghetti code. I decided to start over. This time, I aimed to build a more solid foundation and avoid the spaghetti mess. I installed **ESLint** and wanted to make the rules quite strict. There were many presets available, and I decided to go with the Airbnb config. For the backend, I opted for a more popular stack: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This way, I would have better access to online resources and information.

  

With this transition, we moved our existing components to this structure. New people joined our team, and at one point, we had a team size fluctuating between 2 to 4 members. We weren't very familiar with using GitHub, so we were trying to assign tasks by sending PDFs in a WhatsApp group. This approach led to various problems. My friends and I were all beginners and couldn't write good code.

  

One of the friends who joined the project later suggested that we should set up Storybook and a testing library, and we did, but we didn't use them much. Nevertheless, we had great brainstorming sessions and, through trial and error, I was rapidly advancing in both frontend and backend development.

  

Three months had passed since the project began, and the project had taken shape. However, my friends gradually started to leave the project, and I also wanted to take a break. I evaluated what I had done and began to think about how we could improve it if I were to restart the project. I reached out to many people for mentorship. They all said, *"Sure, we'll handle it, just express what you want to do, and we'll support you,"* but they disappeared within two weeks 😅. Once again, I was on my own.

  

During this period, I researched different technologies. I wondered if I should have built the project with Django, but it was a highly interactive project, and I decided it was best to stick with React. What about Vue or Angular? Were these options? Since I hadn't finished learning React, I didn't want to dive into those as well. I chose to continue with React. Later, I encountered Next.js. I continued my project with Next.js for a while and reintroduced PostgreSQL and Prisma. However, this also presented some challenges, and I reverted to the previous version.

  

It had been about 4 months, and I was feeling stuck. Every time I opened the project, I saw things I wanted to correct. Doing this alone was quite challenging, and I wanted to form a group again, aiming for better collaboration.

  

When I explained the project to a new acquaintance, they said, **"Well, this already exists; it's been done."** Since it had been done, I abandoned my ambitious startup idea I had imagined when I was at this level. I had a long way to go, and I needed professional experience.

  

This process had taken a toll on me. After making the quitting decision, I found myself in a void. What should I do now? Should I start a new big project or work on small ones to fill up my CV? I had been in this situation for about 7 months, and I had only one project I could showcase. Other developers, even if small, were continuously doing multiple projects and sharing them on LinkedIn. Perhaps I should do the same. Thanks to this project, I felt ready for an entry-level job. I needed to showcase myself now.

  

This process had improved me, yes, but I hadn't spent any time on thermodynamics, and I had failed it again. I had only one course left, but web development had captivated me so much that I couldn't focus on thermodynamics, and I extended my time at school by one more semester. I promised myself that this wouldn't happen in the next semester.

  

I started applying for jobs, but I felt like my CV was inadequate, which it was. Then, I wanted to join a bootcamp. This bootcamp would last for 8 weeks, and if I could showcase myself there, maybe I could find a job. The bootcamp was progressing well. Every weekend, we could present the projects we had worked on that week, and I was trying to showcase the projects I thought I had done better than the others. During this period, I also joined another practicum. I couldn't sit idle; I was constantly working on projects. I felt that I was improving in React and TypeScript, and I could now build applications more systematically and quickly. But unfortunately, I didn't get any results from these efforts. Although I thought my final projects were good, it seemed they weren't.

Our school had gone online due to the earthquake disaster. This time, I was focusing on my classes and studying. At the end of the semester, I passed my thermodynamics course with a B, and I graduated.

  

Upon graduating, I had the opportunity to join  [öğrenci baksana](https://ogrencibaksana.com/), which held great significance for me. My ultimate goal was to start my own startup, and I believed that learning teamwork would be more beneficial here in a startup rather than at other companies. I joined the project and have been contributing voluntarily for the past 2 months. In my spare time from this project, I continued to learn new technologies and shape my portfolio website.

  

Yes, we've come to the present day. Currently, I'm learning **Go**. I aim to build applications using **Go** and **htmx**. I keep a close eye on emerging technologies and read articles and blogs as much as possible. After completing this portfolio, I plan to work on a nice project using Go, htmx, and Alpine.js, and continue my learning journey with **Astro 3**, **Bun**, and **Solid.js**.

  

In summary, that's all I can say. Thank you for reading. Have a great day! 🫶🏻
