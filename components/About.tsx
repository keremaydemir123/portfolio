        My journey in web development started in August 2022, and I&apos;ve been
        loving it ever since. I used to study petroleum engineering at METU, but
        I decided to switch to web development, and it&apos;s been a great
        decision. I&apos;ve been learning and making progress consistently, and
        I&apos;m really dedicated to it.
